# Usage
# 1. concat_lanes.sh
concat_lanes <source_dir> <dest_dir>

concat_lanes generates a file merge_reads_by_sample.sh which contains the executable command for all the samples.


#2. merge_reads_by_sample.sh
chmod +x merge_reads_by_sample.sh
qsub ./merge_reads_by_sample.sh

Generates the concatenated files and calculates md5sum for each one, using dest_dir as output dir.
SGE is used for running an array job with all the samples in parallel with openmp parallel environment.  

# Source dir organization
Source directory must be a folder with the next organization:
	- source_dir
		-sample1_SX_LXXX_R1.001.fastq.gz
		-sample1_SX_LXXX_R1.001.fastq.gz
		-sample1_SX_LXXX_R1.001.fastq.gz
        -sample1_SX_LXXX_R2.001.fastq.gz
        -sample1_SX_LXXX_R2.001.fastq.gz
        -sample2_SX_LXXX_R2.001.fastq.gz
 		-sample2_SX_LXXX_R2.001.fastq.gz
 		-.....

Script will use "samplex" as name for the concatenated files.

# Use with SGE and SCRATH FOLDER.
Usage is equal, but the process includes:
 1. Copy fastq files to /scrath partition in the execution node. A folder named concat_$RANDOMNUMBER is created, and files are copied into it.
 2. Concatenation of files and generation of md5sum in /scratch folder.
 3. The output files are copied back to /processing_Data NFS share.
 4. concat_$RANDOMNUMBER folder is deleted from /scrath.


# Accesory Script: check_concat.sh
check_concat.sh <source_dir> <dest_dir>

Experience has shown that sometimes the concatenation process fails. Consequently check_concat.sh script has been developed.
This is a simple script than counts how many lines are in lanes files in source_dir and the number of lines in the concatenated file in dest_dir. 
If the number match, the output shows a success note, else it shows a fail note.
